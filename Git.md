This repo shows you on how to get started on git (the best and most extensive documentation and tutorial is still this [one](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2))

The overall goal of Git is version control. That sounds really confusing at first, but I bet you, we all have been in this position once. For me, it was when I was writing my Bachelor thesis. At the end, after 3 months of writing, I had around 10 different versions of my work. Some of them were my "secure saves", others were corrected versions from peers, ... . In the end, it took me a really really long time, to read through all of them and incorporate all the different corrections. I could have had a way easier life, if I would have used Git. This tool can easily control different versions of different files and, if there is a new part it merges it or if there is a correction at the same place, it raises a merge conflict, so the user can review it manually.

# Installation
> ✨ This is a quick guide on how to install git and what to look out for

In order to get Git please visit their official [website](https://git-scm.com/). Already on this site, it should give you an option to download git. Please go ahead and download Git. During the installation make sure to enable "Git Bash Here" (for Windows users).

Then you can go ahead and install git. From now on onwards, at least for Windows users, if you right click in any folder within your explorer it should give you the option for "Git Bash Here". 

# Set-up
> ⚙️ Here is shortly explained how to configure your git

For all the Windows users, you can now go ahead and open the Git Bash (remember this is only a right click in any folder in your explorer). For Mac Users, you can just go ahead and open the Command line. This does the same job.

For Windows users it should look something like this:

Now please visit [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) link, since this is the official getting started tutorial from Git, and I cannot put it into better words.

# Clone
> 🔬 What is ```git clone``` and how to use it

 The command ```git clone ...``` enables you to *copy* a already existing Repository from either Github.com or Gitlab.com. This is especially useful for collaboration, since now you can easily share your project using this platform. You can clone a repository if you go onto their landing page in either Github or Gitlab. It should look something like this:
 ![Github Repository](images/Screenshot%20Github%20Repo.jpg)

If you now go ahead and click on the green box **Code** a dropdown should open. There is a link in it, which I want you to copy.
