# How to ... Access Wharton High Performance Computer Cluster

In order to access the **W**harton **R**search **D**ata **S**ervice (WRDS) you have to have an account there. In order to use this service you have to log in on their page.

Once you are logged in you can can either access [this](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/support/programming-wrds/programming-python/python-wrds-cloud/) link or simply click on *Support* > *Python* > *PYTHON: On the WRDS Cloud*. It will lead you to the same site. From there one the process is pretty well explained.

A few, in my opinion, quite important take aways:
1. One can use IPython directly on the cloud (one cannot save notebook!)
2. One can send their scripts using shell scripts (explained [here](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/support/programming-wrds/programming-python/submitting-python-programs/)) to their server (no need for local ressources!)
3. One can shut of their computer while the job is still executing
4. One can request up to [8 CPUs with each 6 GB of RAM](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/support/the-wrds-cloud/running-jobs/batch-jobs-wrds-cloud/)
5. One can create their own [virtual environment](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/support/programming-wrds/programming-python/installing-your-own-python-packages/) and install packages which are needed!
6. Apart from Python it supports various other languages!
7. Several jobs can be send to the server!

Take aways:

- Depending on your machine this can be quite faster!
- Now no need for spending own local resources and for the Laptop to do the work!
- Underrated/Unknown awesome functionality at FS.
